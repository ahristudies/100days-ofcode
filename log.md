# 100 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒 - 𝐿𝑜𝑔 💫

### Day 01 July 13, 2022 
##### (cries in portuguese language)

**Today's Progress**: Project started from scratch, main challenges were the button, how to align text and image side by side, I spent the whole afternoon doing this. Also I had difficulty putting opacity on the image when it is on hover (seriously, it took almost 1 hour to discover the opacity function).

**Thoughts:** I created a project from the beginning, inspired by a project I saw (<a href="https://codepen.io/HenrikFricke/pen/GRNYrXK">you can see it here</a>), I ran out of ideas of what to actually put, maybe I don't have that much creativity to think of a sales blog or something, so I did inspired in the song I was listening to at the time, the idea was to put to the test what I've learned about CSS and HTML so far in a bootcamp I'm doing. Using mobile devices I noticed that it is still not responsive, this is something I will fix tomorrow (even because it's my responsive class tomorrow)

**Today's Progress**: I started my portfolio, I wanted to have the experience of creating something for someone, understand more design and coding. Anyway, I had a lot of trouble understanding Bootstrap and setting up a navbar. But, a lot of progress in understanding more CSS. Tomorrow I will do the portfolio part itself, I need to do that before traveling. About the updates from the previous project, I preferred to organize it to do every 5 days of the challenge, so it's easier to search for improvements.

**Thoughts:** Today was very busy because I wanted to start doing my project, but tomorrow I'm going to travel (I still don't know how I'm going to update the challenge). I had the brilliant idea to start this website for my portfolio while getting my hair done at the salon. It lasted I think for a while, but then I lost focus... I'm hopeful with what can come out, I loved the choice of colors, what I managed to do using HTML and CSS, and a lot of google.
